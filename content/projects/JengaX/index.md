description: "JengaX is a VR system that transforms a traditional physics classroom into an interactive playground. Students can access and interact with 3D-rendered objects by simply touching or dragging a 2D figure in the classroom presentation. It is in its early development stage and we are conducting literature review."

##### Abstract

Making abstract concepts understandable to children remains challenging. <strong>Embodied analogies</strong> hold great promise for bridging this
gap; however, a single, fixed analogy is often employed in embodied learning environments, which risks surface-level understanding,
limiting knowledge transfer for new domains. We present <strong>EmbodiedCreate</strong>, a novel embodied learning activity that supports
analogical learning of AI concepts through the <strong>Use-Modify-Create</strong> process. It enables students to experience a single embodied analogy,
then modify multiple analogies capturing the same concepts, and finally create their own analogies. Through an exploratory study
with 17 students (8 high-school, 9 middle-school), we found that: (1) multiple analogies can promote knowledge construction, with
learners generating novel mappings between the target and source knowledge; and (2) the creation process supports learners to
externalize, critique, and refine their understanding of the AI concepts. Our findings also uncover design implications and challenges
of child-AI embodied co-creation for future educational technologies.
