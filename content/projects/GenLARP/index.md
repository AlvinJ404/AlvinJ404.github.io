##### Abstract

We introduce <strong>GenLARP</strong>, a <strong>virtual reality (VR)</strong> system that transforms personalized stories into immersive live action role-playing
(LARP) experiences. GenLARP enables users to act as both <strong>creators and players</strong>, allowing them to design characters based on their
descriptions and live in the story world. Generative AI and agents powered by <strong>Large Language Models (LLMs)</strong> enrich these experiences.
